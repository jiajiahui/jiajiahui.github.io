      <h6>Every invention in art is a single event in time, has no evolution. With the passage of time different varia­tions of the same theme are composed around the in­vention, sometimes more sharpened, sometimes more flattened, but seldom is the original power attained. So it goes on till, after being performed over a long period, this work of art becomes so automatic-mechan­ical in its performance that the mind ceases to respond to the exhausted theme; then the time is ripe for a new invention. The so-called 'technical' aspect is, however, inseparable from the so-called 'artistic' aspect and therefore we do not wish to dismiss close associations lightly, with a few catchwords. In any case, Gutenberg, the inventor of the system of printing from movable type, printed a few books by this method which stand as the highest achievement in book art. Then there follow a few centuries which produced no fundamental inventions in our field (up to the invention of photography). What we find, more or less, in the art of printing are masterly variations accompanied by technical improvement in the pro­duction of the instruments. The same thing happened with a second invention in the visual field - with pho­tography. The moment we stop riding complacently on our high horse, we have to admit that the first daguerreotypes are not primitive rough-and-ready things, but the highest achievements in the field of the photographic art. It is short-sighted to think that the machine alone, that is to say the supplanting of manual processes by mechanical ones, is fundamental to the changing of the appearance and form of things. In the first place it is the consumer who determines the change by his requirements; I refer to the stratum of society that furnishes the 'commission'. To-day it is not a narrow circle, a thin upper layer, but 'All', the masses. The idea which moves the masses to-day is called materialism, but what precisely characterizes the present time is dematerialization. An example: correspondence grows, the number of letters in­creases, the amount of paper written on and material used up swells, then the telephone-call relieves the strain. Then comes further growth of the communi­cations network and increase in the volume of communications; then radio eases the burden. The amount of material used is decreasing, we are dema­terializing, cumbersome masses of material are being supplanted by released energies. That is the sign of our time. What kind of conclusions can we draw from these observations, with reference to our field of activity? I put forward the following analogies:</h6>

     <div class="clearfix grpelem" id="u2261-18"><!-- content -->
      <h6 id="u2261-2"><span class="white-main-pro" id="u2261">I submit these analogies in order to demonstrate that as long as the book is of necessity a hand-held object, that is to say not yet supplanted by sound recordings or talking pictures, we must wait from day to day for new fundamental inventions in the field of book-pro­duction, so that here also we may reach the standard of the time.</span></h6>
      <h6 id="u2261-4"><span class="white-main-pro" id="u2261-3">Present indications are that this basic invention can be expected from the neighbouring field of collo­type. This process involves a machine which transfers the composed type-matter on to a film, and a printing­machine which copies the negative on to sensitive paper. Thus the enormous weight of type and the bucket of ink disappear, and so here again we also have dematerialization. The most important aspect is that the production style for word and illustration is subject to one and the same process - to the collotype, to photography. Up to the present there has been no kind of representation as completely comprehensible to all people as photography. So we are faced with a book-form in which representation is primary and the alphabet secondary.</span></h6>
      <h6 id="u2261-6"><span class="white-main-pro" id="u2261-5">We know two kinds of writing: a symbol for each idea = hieroglyph (in China today) and a symbol for each sound = letter. The progress of the letter in relation to the hieroglyph is relative. The hieroglyph is international: that is to say, if a Russian, a German, or an American impresses the symbols (pictures) of theideas on his memory, he can read Chinese or Egyptian (silently), without acquiring a knowledge of the language, for language and writing are each a pattern in itself. This is an advantage which the letter-book has lost. So I believe that the next book-form will be plastic-representational. We can say that</span></h6>
      <h6 id="u2261-8"><span class="white-main-pro" id="u2261-7">to understand it, one must at least learn.</span></h6>
      <h6 id="u2261-10"><span class="white-main-pro" id="u2261-9">( l) the hieroglyph-book is international ( at least in its potentiality),</span></h6>
      <h6 id="u2261-12"><span class="white-main-pro" id="u2261-11">(2)&nbsp; the letter-book is national, and</span></h6>
      <h6 id="u2261-14"><span class="white-main-pro" id="u2261-13">(3)&nbsp; the coming book will be a􀀺national: for in order</span></h6>
      <h6 id="u2261-16"><span class="white-main-pro" id="u2261-15">To-day we have two dimensions for the word. As a sound it is a function of time, and as a representation it is a function of space. The coming book must be both. In this way the automatism of the present-day book will be overcome; for a view of life which has come about automatically is no longer conceivable to our minds and we are left suffocating in a vacuum. The energetic task which art must accomplish is to transmute the emptiness into space, that is into something which our minds can grasp as an organized unity.</span></h6>

       <h6>With the start of the reconstruction period about 1922, book-production also increases rapidly. Our best artists take up the problem of book design. At the beginning of 1922 we publish, with the poet Ilya Ehrenburg, the periodical Veshch ('Object'), which is printed in Berlin. Thanks to the high standard of German technology we succeed in realizing some of our book ideas. So the picture-book 'Of Two Squares' which was completed in our creative period of 1920, is also printed, and also the Mayakovsky-book, where the book-form itself is given a functional shape in keeping with its specific purpose. In the same period our artists obtain the technical facilities for printing. The State Publishing House and other printing­establishments publish books, which have since been seen and appreciated at several international exhibi­tions in Europe. Comrades Popova, Rodchenko, Klutsis, Syenkin, Stepanova and Gan devote themselves to the book. Some of them work in the printing­works itself, aiong with the compositor and the machine ( Gan and several others). The degree of respect for the actual art of printing which is acquired by doing this is shown by the fact that all the names of the compositors and feeders of any particular book are listed in it, on a special page. Thus in the printing­works there comes to be a select number of workers who cultivate a very conscious relationship with their art.</h6>
       <h6>&nbsp;</h6>
       <h6>Most artists make montages, that is to say, with photographs and the inscriptions belonging to them they piece together whole pages, which are then pho­tographically reproduced for printing. In this way there develops a technique of simple effectiveness, which appears to be very easy to operate and for that reason can easily develop into dull routine, but which in powerful hands turns out to be the most successful method of achieving visual poetry.</h6>
       <h6>&nbsp;</h6>
       <h6>At the very beginning we said that the expressive power of every invention in art is an isolated phenom­enon and has no evolution. The invention of easel­pictures produced great works of art, but their effec­tiveness has been lost. The cinema and the illustrated weekly magazine have triumphed. We rejoice at the new media which technology has placed at our dis­posal. We know that being in close contact with worldwide events and keeping pace with the progress of social development, that with the perpetual sharp­ening of our optic nerve, with the mastery of plastic material, with construction of the plane and its space, with the force which keeps inventiveness at boiling­point, with all these new assets, we know that finally we shall give a new effectiveness to the book as a work of art.</h6>
       <h6>&nbsp;</h6>
       <h6>Yet, in this present day and age we still have no new shape for the book as a body; it continues to bea cover with a jacket, and a spine, and pages I, 2, 3 ... We still have the same thing in the theatre also. Up to now in our country, even the newest theatrical pro­ductions have been performed in the picture-frame style of theatre, with the public accommodated in the stalls, in boxes, in the circles, all in front of the cur­tain. The stage, however, has been cleared of the painted scenery; the painted-in-perspective stage area has become extinct. In the same picture-frame a three-dimensional physical space has been born, for the maximum development of the fourth dimension, living movement. This new-born theatre explodes the old theatre-building. Perhaps the new work in the inside of the book is not yet at the stage of exploding the traditional book-form, but we should have learnt by now to recognize the tendency.</h6>
       <h6>&nbsp;</h6>
       <h6>Notwithstanding the crises which book-production is suffering, in common with other areas of production, the book-glacier is growing year by year. The book is becoming the most monumental work of art: no longer is it something caressed only by the delicate hands of a few bibliophiles; on the contrary, it is already being grasped by hundreds of thousands of poor people. This also explains the dominance, in our transition period, of the illustrated weekly magazine. Moreover, in our country a stream of childrens' picture-books has appeared, to swell the inundation of illustrated periodicals. By reading, our children are already acquiring a new plastic language; they are growing up with a different relationship to the world and to space, to shape and to colour; they will surely also create another book. We, however, are satisfied if in our book the lyric and epic evolution of our times is given shape.</h6>

      <h6>With changes in the language, in construction and style, the visual aspect of the book changes also. Before the war, European printed matter looked much the same in all countries. In America there was a new optimistic mentality, concerned with the day in hand, focused on immediate impressions, and this began to create a new form of printed matter. It was there that they first started to shift the emphasis and make the word be the illustration of the picture, instead of the other way round, as in Europe. Moreover, the highly­developed technique of the process block made a particular contribution; and so photomontage was invented.</h6>
      <h6>Post-war Europe, sceptical and bewildered, is culti­vating a shrieking, bellowing language; one must hold one's own and keep up with everything. Words like 'attraction' and 'trick' are becoming the catchwords of the time. The appearance of the book is characte­rized by: (1) fragmented type panel, (2) photomon­tage and typomontage.</h6>
      <h6>All these facts are like an aeroplane. Before the war and our revolution it was carrying us along the runway to the take-off point. We are now becomingairborne and our faith for the future is in the aero­plane - that is to say in these facts.</h6>
      <h6>&nbsp;</h6>
      <h6>The idea of the 'simultaneous' book also originated in the pre-war era and was realized after a fashion. I refer to a poem by Blaise Cendrars, typographically designed by Sonia Delaunay-Terk, which is on a folding strip of paper, 1.50 metres in length; so it was an experiment with a new book-form for poetry. The lines of the poem are printed in colours, according to content, so that they go over from one colour to another following the changes in meaning.</h6>
      <h6>In England during the war, the Vortex Group published its work BLAST, large and elementary in presentation, set almost exclusively in block letters; today this has become the feature of all modern inter­national printed matter. In Germany, the prospectus for the small Grosz portfolio Neue Jugend, produced in 1917, is an important document of the new typo­graphy.</h6>
      <h6>&nbsp;</h6>
      <h6>With us in Russia the new movement began in 1908, and from its very first day linked painters and poets closely together; practically no book of poetry appeared which had not had the collaboration of a painter. The poems were written and illustrated with the lithographic crayon, or engraved in wood. The poets themselves typeset whole pages. Among those who worked in this way were the poets Khlebnikov, Kruchenykh, Mayakovsky, Asseyev, together with the painters Rozanova, Goncharova, Malevich, Popova, Burlyuk etc. These were not numbered, de luxe copies, they were cheap, unbound, paperbacked books, which we must consider today, in spite of their urbanity, as popular art.</h6>
      <h6>&nbsp;</h6>
      <h6>During the period of the Revolution a latent energy accumulated in our young generation of artists, which merely awaited the great mandate from the people for it to be released and deployed. It is the great masses, the semi-literate masses, who have become the audience. The Revolution in our country accom­plished an enormous educational and propagandistic task. The traditional book was torn into separate pages, enlarged a hundred-fold, coloured for greater intensity, and brought into the street as a poster. By contrast with the American poster, created for people who will catch a momentary glimpse whilst speedingpast in their automobiles, ours was meant for people who would stand quite close and read it over and make sense out of it. If today a number of posters were to be reproduced in the size of a manageable book, then arranged according to theme and bound, the result could be the most original book. Because of the need for speed and the great lack of possibilities for printing, the best work was mostly done by hand; it was standardized, concise in its text, and most suited to the simplest mechanical method of duplication. State laws were printed in the same way as folding picture-books, army orders in the same way as paper­backed brochures.</h6>
      <h6>&nbsp;</h6>
      <h6>At the end of the Civil War (1920) we were given the opportunity, using primitive mechanical means, of personally realizing our aims in the field of new book-design. In Vitebsk we produced a work entitled Unovis in five copies, using typewriter, lithography, etching and linocuts. I wrote in it: 'Gutenberg's Bible was printed with letters only; but the Bible of our time cannot be just presented in letters alone. The book finds its channel to the brain through the eye, not through the ear; in this channel the waves rush through with much greater speed and pressure than in the acoustic channel. One can speak out only through the mouth, but the book's facilities for ex­pression take many more forms.'</h6>
